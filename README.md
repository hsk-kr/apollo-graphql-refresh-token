# Apollo GraphQL Refresh Token

This is an example of how to implement the process to refresh a token when the token is invalid in Apollo GraphQL.

You can reference the detail in my post ["React Apollo: JWT & Refresh Token"](https://dev.to/lico/react-apollo-refresh-tokens-5h0k) on Dev.to.

There is another implementation for the refreshing token process used `Link`. Check this out in [the `link` branch](https://github.com/hsk-kr/apollo-graphql-refresh-token/tree/link).
